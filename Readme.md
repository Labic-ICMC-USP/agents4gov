# Agents4Gov

**Laboratory of Computational Intelligence (LABIC â€“ ICMC/USP)**


## Overview

**Agents4Gov** is a research and development project from **LABIC â€“ Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences (ICMC/USP)** focused on building **LLM-based tools** to support and modernize **public sector services**.
The project emphasizes **local Large Language Models (LLMs)** for privacy, **data anonymization**, and the **development and evaluation of tools** for use in government and institutional environments.

## Installation

### 1. Install the Open WebUI Server

Agents4Gov is built on top of the **[Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)** framework, which serves as the base environment for loading and running tools.

Before starting, ensure you are using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

To install and run Open WebUI:

```bash
# Install Open WebUI
pip install open-webui

# Start the server
open-webui serve
```

After starting, the Open WebUI interface will be available at:
ðŸ‘‰ **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

---

### 2. Clone the Agents4Gov Repository

In the same environment, clone the Agents4Gov repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icmc-usp/Agents4Gov.git
```

The `tools/` directory inside the repository contains all implemented tools.

---

### 3. Import Tools into Open WebUI

Once Open WebUI is running:

1. Access the **Tools** module in the Open WebUI interface.
2. Use the **Import Tool** option to add any of the tools from the `Agents4Gov/tools/` directory.
3. Each tool has its own documentation and configuration guide within its folder.

Example:

```bash
ls Agents4Gov/tools/
```

Each subdirectory corresponds to an individual tool that can be imported, executed, and evaluated directly within Open WebUI.
